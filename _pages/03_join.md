<h3>Frequently Asked Questions </h3>
<details>
	<summary>
		<h4>Do I need to have experience to join ACM Design?</h4>
	</summary>
	<p>No! If you are interested in becoming a general member, you are more than welcome to attend our workshops and events without any prior knowledge! We teach from the ground up so come if you are interested! As for recruitment, you will need to understand design principles, but you do not need formal experience or even a portfolio. Just be prepared to talk about what you think makes good design!</p>

	<summary>
		<h4>What is the difference between being a general member vs. an intern vs. an officer in ACM Design?</h4>
	</summary>
	<p>General members are free to come and go to any events they wish and the time commitment is very flexible. There is no need to apply or recruit if a student wishes to be a general member.
	Interns are selected through a recruitment process that occurs every fall. Interns undergo design training to understand ACM’s design guidelines and are able to work on internal projects and design requests.
	Officers are either selected through a recruitment process that occurs during spring or are promoted interns who have stayed in ACM Design for over a quarter. Officers have the opportunity to run for board, lead a workshop, and/or manage a project if they wish.</p>

	<summary>
		<h4>What is the workload/time commitment like as an intern/officer?</h4>
	</summary>
	<p>This varies on the project, an intern/officer’s personal schedule, and how much they want to take on. We respect everyone’s goals and do our best to support our members in whatever way we can. Typically, our members spend around 3 hours a week for ACM Design.</p>

		<h4>When does ACM recruitment occur?</h4>
	</summary>
	<p>ACM recruitment happens twice a year - in the fall for interns and in the spring for officers. The timeline for both is very similar and the whole process takes about 3-4 weeks. Candidates will have about two weeks to fill out the general application where they can answer questions in the design section if they are interested in joining ACM Design. Interviews will usually happen the week after applications close. ACM Design conducts 30-45 minute interviews with the first part being behavioral and the second part asking about a candidate’s design workstyle with some time at the end for questions.</p>
