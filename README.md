## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Run `npm install`
3. If you already have a _site folder, delete that folder. Run `npm run start`, and the generated output will be in the _site folder.

You should be good to go!

The scripts in `package.json` are configured so any file changes will cause eleventy and sass to automatically recompile when running.

To install Westwood Sans from its repository, run `git submodule init`
To update, run `git pull --recurse-submodules`
